### FAQ

1. Do not extract in a directory with non-English characters.
2. Add the download and extraction directories to the antivirus software or Windows Defender whitelist, then extract the
   files again.
3. You may need to turn off Windows HDR, eye protection low blue light mode, and automatic application color management
   in advanced display settings. Use default brightness for games, disable all features that change game colors, like
   Nvidia/AMD game filters/sharpening, and close any overlays displaying FPS, GPU information, etc.
4. If you are not using the default QER keys, change the keys in the ok-ww settings. Mouse side buttons are not
   supported as shortcuts; otherwise, they will only perform basic attacks.
5. If OK-GI is not updated to the latest version, update to the latest version.
6. Ensure the game can run stably at 60fps
7. If you still have issues, submit a BUG report.
